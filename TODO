add() with a position, threadsafe!



-> view instance helpers
	-> teardown() // does teardown
	-> events onTeardown(position)
	-> .$() -> jQuery-single-elem
	-> .$('.css-search') -> child elements
	-> .$(jQuery instance | HTMLElement) assigns this objects dom
	
	// required to be defined by the user for it to be used in a collection
	!! id() required to work with a collection
	
	// aquired only when added to a collection view! ...
	-> collection()
	-> removeFromCollection() //detach and delete these two functions

-> collection specialisations:
	-> $container[()]
	-> add(subview, [position])
	-> events onSubviewRemoved(subview, position) onSubviewAdded(subview, position)
	-> find(id)
